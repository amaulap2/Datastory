### Bot awards

We learnt more about bots characteristics, the different behaviors and metrics we used to identify bots. 

With all these metrics we were able to identify some very special bots which topped their peers in one ore more metrics, it is now time to get to know them better and to understand what kind of bots do they represent. 

First let's define the name of the metrics:
Abbreviation of the different attributes for the card
    Lifetime: LIF : (Duration from first to last day where we detected a suspicious activity.)
    Maximum daily comments made in a day: MDC : 
    Total number of comments on the lifetime: TLC
    Maximum number of different videos commented in a day: MVD
    Maximum number of different videos commented in total: MVT
    Number of suspicious days: NSD : (max of NSD with filter 1 and filter 2)

Agent Smith clearly played with YT bot detection algorithm, he produced 154 765 comments on a regular basis since we detected him 2907 different days with our filters! His human appearance clearly helped him to remain unbanned for such a long time!
