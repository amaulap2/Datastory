# Bots Awards 

We learned more about bots' characteristics, behaviors, and the metrics we used to identify them.  

With all these metrics, we were able to identify some **very special bots** that outperformed their peers in one or more metrics. Now it's time to get to know them better and understand what kind of bots they represent.


## üìä **Definition of Metrics**

Here are the abbreviations and descriptions of the different attributes we use to evaluate bots:

- **LIF (Lifetime):** Duration from the first to the last day where we detected suspicious activity.  
- **MDC (Maximum Daily Comments):** Maximum number of comments made in a single day.  
- **TLC (Total Lifetime Comments):** Total number of comments during the bot's lifetime.  
- **MVD (Maximum Videos Commented in a Day):** Maximum number of different videos commented on in a single day.  
- **MVT (Maximum Videos Commented in Total):** Maximum number of different videos commented on across the bot's lifetime.  
- **NSD (Number of Suspicious Days):** Maximum suspicious days detected (between the number of suspicious days detected by Filter 1 and Filter 2).

## üèÖ **1. Award for the Most Curious Bot**

<div style="text-align: center;" id="lifetime_1">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/data/bot_ranking/HAL_stats.svg" alt="HAL 9000 Statistics">
  <p><strong>HAL 9000 Statistics</strong></p>
</div>

**HAL 9000** is undoubtedly the **most curious bot**, having commented on over **352,020 different videos**!  

A remarkable effort from the villain of *2001: A Space Odyssey*. **Kubrick** would surely be proud of this relentless digital creation!



## ‚è≥ **2. Award for the Longest-Lived Bot**

<div style="text-align: center;" id="lifetime_1">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/data/bot_ranking/C-3PO_stats.svg" alt="C-3PO Statistics">
  <p><strong>C-3PO Statistics</strong></p>
</div>

**C-3PO**, known for his harmless and polite manners in the galaxy, holds the record for the **longest lifetime** among all detected bots. He remained active for an impressive **5,245 days**.  

However, during this extensive lifespan, he only posted **81 comments** and was flagged for suspicious activity just **5 times**.  

With so few comments, it‚Äôs entirely possible that **C-3PO** was not a bot at all, but rather a regular user who returned to comment on YouTube **more than 14 years later**. Perhaps he‚Äôs the most well-behaved bot... or just an innocent, long-lost YouTuber.

## üí• **3. Award for the Most Over-the-Top Performer**

<div style="text-align: center;" id="lifetime_1">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/data/bot_ranking/T-800_stats.svg" alt="T-800 Statistics">
  <p><strong>T-800 Statistics</strong></p>
</div>

As expected, the **T-800** doesn't do things by halves. A true over-the-top performer, **he went all in** and left no room for subtlety.  

The Terminator, famously portrayed by **Arnold Schwarzenegger**, posted an unbelievable **30,990 comments in a single day**! Then, just as dramatically, he almost stopped all activity. A classic example of brute force!

## üèÜ **4. Award for the Most Suspicious Days Without Being Banned**

<div style="text-align: center;" id="lifetime_1">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/data/bot_ranking/SMITH_stats.svg" alt="Agent Smith Statistics">
  <p><strong>Agent Smith Statistics</strong></p>
</div>

**Agent Smith** clearly outsmarted YouTube's bot detection algorithm. He produced an astonishing **154,765 comments** during his time and was detected on **2,907 different days** using our filters!  

His human-like behavior, beside once when he posted **1387 comments in a day** allowed him to remain undetected and unbanned for so long. Agent Smith is truly the **GOAT** of stealth and persistence.
